- Make the frontend do something vaguely useful with the data
  - 
- Talk to reddit with praw
  - how this going

#  sadge :((

(?:\s|^)(?:\$([A-Z]{1,5}|[a-z]{1,5})|([A-Z]{1,5}))(?=(?:[\s.,?!]|$))

X Make a DO space
X Get the boto3s


WHAT TO DO: BASIC AS FUNCTIONALITY

- use reddit jsons to get data
    - we should do
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments.json?limit=100
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets.json?limit=100
- use apis to get the old data and integrate with current data
  - JK too hard let's not :)
  - what this mean
- figure out what the hecking heck format we are storing this data in within the json
  - what are we doing with the data
  - what are we actually doing
  - what is the goal
  - stock counts
  - do buckets exist
    - no

  - we write some json bullshit
    - we can have whatever we want

  - block by hour
    - just the symbols and their counts
    - cool story bro TM
     
    - ok question tho
      - do we save the stock price at that hour with the symbols
      - to be able to track the price along with mentions
      - or do it not matter 

- save internal data to a digital ocean space so we can resume if there is a service interuption
  - JK too hard let's not :) yeah fuck this rn tbh
